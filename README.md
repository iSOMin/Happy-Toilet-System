# Happy-Toilet-System

## details<br>
This System is developed for happier toilet experiences.<br>
Sometimes, we experience annoying situation in the toilet <br>
when there's not enough toilet paper <br>
or forget that you put something on the shelf.<br>


## used these<br>
* Arduino Uno<br>
* Ultrosonic sensor<br>
* LED<br>
* lazor<br>
* LDR sensor<br>
* piezo buzer<br>

<br>
### 1. Toilet Paper<br>
For this part, system gets distance from ultrasonic sensor to existing toilet paper.<br>
If toilet paper is full, green color LED is on.<br>
If toilet paper is enough, yellow color LED is on.<br>
If there's a little toilet paper, red color LED is on.<br>
<br>
### 2. Things on the Shelf<br>
For this part, system gets LDR result.<br>
If something is on the shelf, it prevents lazer to shoot LDR.<br>
Then the system knows there's something on the shelf.<br>
If the door is opened but something is still on the shelf, piezo buzer makes noise.<br>
Important thing is that it works only when the door is being opened.<br>
For example, if a person put something on the shelf before close the door, it doesn't make noise. 
Because some people put something on the shelf before using the toilet.<br>
However, if the person open the door without the thing he or she put on the shelf, then it makes noise.<br><br>

This is all about this system!
This was developed in coalamovement, Pusan National University, Republic of Korea!
